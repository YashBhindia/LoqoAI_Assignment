## Specifications

### Setup
- Use Spring Boot to create the application.
- Use MYSql as the database.

## Installation & Run

- Before running the API server, you should update the database config inside the [application.properties] file.
- Update the port number, username and password as per your local database config.

```
    server.port=8888

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:8080/loqodb;
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=root

```

### MYSql Collection
Assume you have a MySql collection named `product` with the following structure:

 {
    "_id": "ObjectId",
    "name": "string",
